# Abstract<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

Learning engineering concepts without hands-on examples can be a difficult task for some students. Traditionally in the classroom, concepts are taught and examples are given, but working with them is left as a homework exercise. This method misses out on the opportunity to use programming in the classroom as a supplemental teaching tool for hands-on learning. Org-mode in Emacs solves this problem by allowing an instructor to contain lecture material and executable code inside a single document that they can give to their students. This poster shows how it is possible to use an Org-mode file to develop a lesson plan that makes the most out of having students working with code inside the same document as lecture notes.
